A convolutional neural network model trained on the intel image classification. This model is able to classify between 6 different categories

1) buildings
2) forest
3) glacier
4) mountain
5) sea
6) street

the model currently has 78% validation accuracy I have also made another jupyter notebook which uses the trained model and to visualize the results of the model and annotate them onto an image I have used opencv

the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data
